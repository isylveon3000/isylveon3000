- 👋 Hi, I’m SpaceWD
- 👀 I’m interested in: Club Penguin, Team Fortress 2 & TF2 servers, HTML, & CSS
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in: building a computer VM that runs in the javascript console that runs an instance of SteamCMD and can run a safe TF2 server that cannot be DDoS'ed and can not be edited by the general public.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Nothing! I'm an independent coder on github
- 📫 How to reach me: I have recently been active on Steam.
